# Rendering

The rendering namespace contains all the classes used for core rendering in PixiJS
this includes all the lower level resources such as Textures, Shaders, State, Buffers,
Geometry and the systems required to use them. This covers WebGL and WebGPU and their shared classes.
To automatically create a renderer based on available resources, see the {@link autoDetectRenderer} function.
