/**
 * A wrapper for a WebGPU/WebGL Buffer.
 * In PixiJS, the Buffer class is used to manage the data that is sent to the GPU rendering pipeline.
 * It abstracts away the underlying GPU buffer and provides an interface for uploading typed arrays or other data to the GPU,
 * They are used in the following places:
 * <br><br>
 * .1. {@link Geometry} as attribute data or index data for geometry
 * <br>
 * .2. {@link UniformGroup} as an underlying buffer for uniform data
 * <br>
 * .3. {@link BufferResource} as an underlying part of a buffer used directly by the GPU program
 * <br>
 *
 * It is important to note that you must provide a usage type when creating a buffer. This is because
 * the underlying GPU buffer needs to know how it will be used. For example, if you are creating a buffer
 * to hold vertex data, you would use `BufferUsage.VERTEX`. This will tell the GPU that this buffer will be
 * used as a vertex buffer. This is important because it will affect how you can use the buffer.
 *
 * Buffers are updated by calling the {@link Buffer.update} method. This immediately updates the buffer on the GPU.
 * Be mindful of calling this more often than you need to. It is recommended to update buffers only when needed.
 *
 * In WebGPU, a GPU buffer cannot resized. This limitation is abstracted away, but know that resizing a buffer means
 * creating a brand new one and destroying the old, so it is best to limit this if possible.
 * @example
 *
 * const buffer = new Buffer({
 *     data: new Float32Array([1, 2, 3, 4]),
 *     usage: BufferUsage.VERTEX,
 * });
 * @memberof rendering
