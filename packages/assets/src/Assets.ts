/**
 * A one stop shop for all Pixi resource management!
 * Super modern and easy to use, with enough flexibility to customize and do what you need!
 * @memberof PIXI
 * @namespace Assets
 *
 * Only one Asset Class exists accessed via the Global Asset object.
 *
 * It has four main responsibilities:
 * 1. Allows users to map URLs to keys and resolve them according to the user's browser capabilities
 * 2. Loads the resources and transforms them into assets that developers understand.
 * 3. Caches the assets and provides a way to access them.
 * 4: Allow developers to unload assets and clear the cache.
 *
 * It also has a few advanced features:
 * 1. Allows developers to provide a manifest upfront of all assets and help manage them via 'bundles'
 * 2. Allows users to background load assets. Shortening (or eliminating) load times and improving UX. With this feature,
 * in-game loading bars can be a thing of the past!
 *
 *
 * Do not be afraid to load things multiple times - under the hood, it will NEVER load anything more than once.
 *
 * for example:
 *
 * ```
 * promise1 = PIXI.Assets.load('bunny.png')
 * promise2 = PIXI.Assets.load('bunny.png')
 *
 * //promise1 === promise2
 * ```
 * here both promises will be the same. Once resolved.. forever resolved! It makes for really easy resource management!
 *
 * Out of the box it supports the following files:
 * * textures (avif, webp, png, jpg, gif)
 * * sprite sheets (json)
 * * bitmap fonts (xml, fnt, txt)
 * * web fonts (ttf, woff, woff2)
 * * json files (json)
 * * text files (txt)
 *
 * More types can be added fairly easily by creating additional loader parsers.
 *
 * ### Textures
 * - Textures are loaded as ImageBitmap on a worker thread where possible.
 * Leading to much less janky load + parse times.
 * - By default, we will prefer to load AVIF and WebP image files if you specify them.
 * But if the browser doesn't support AVIF or WebP we will fall back to png and jpg.
 * - Textures can also be accessed via Texture.from(...) and now use this asset manager under the hood!
 * - Don't worry if you set preferences for textures that don't exist (for example you prefer 2x resolutions images
 *  but only 1x is available for that texture, the Asset manager will pick that up as a fallback automatically)
 * #### Sprite sheets
 * - it's hard to know what resolution a sprite sheet is without loading it first, to address this
 * there is a naming convention we have added that will let Pixi understand the image format and resolution
 * of the spritesheet via its file name:
 *
 * `my-spritesheet{resolution}.{imageFormat}.json`
 *
 * for example:
 *
 * `my-spritesheet@2x.webp.json` // 2x resolution, WebP sprite sheet
 * `my-spritesheet@0.5x.png.json` // 0.5x resolution, png sprite sheet
 *
 * This is optional! you can just load a sprite sheet as normal,
 * This is only useful if you have a bunch of different res / formatted spritesheets
 *
 * ### Fonts
 * * Web fonts will be loaded with all weights.
 * it is possible to load only specific weights by doing the following:
 *
 * ```
 * // load specific weights..
 * await PIXI.Assets.load({
 *    data: {
 *      weights: ['normal'], // only loads the weight
 *    },
 *    src: `outfit.woff2`,
 * });
 *
 * // load everything...
 * await PIXI.Assets.load(`outfit.woff2`);
 * ```
 * ### Background Loading
 * Background loading will load stuff for you passively behind the scenes. To minimize jank,
 * it will only load one asset at a time. As soon as a developer calls `PIXI.Assets.load(...)` the
 * background loader is paused and requested assets are loaded as a priority.
 * Don't worry if something is in there that's already loaded, it will just get skipped!
 *
 * You still need to call `PIXI.Assets.load(...)` to get an asset that has been loaded in the background.
 * It's just that this promise will resolve instantly if the asset
 * has already been loaded.
 *
 * ### Manifest and Bundles
 * - Manifest is a JSON file that contains a list of all assets and their properties.
 * - Bundles are a way to group assets together.
 *
 * ```
 * // manifest example
 * const manifest = {
 *   bundles:[{
 *      name:'load-screen',
 *      assets:[
 *          {
 *             name: 'background',
 *             srcs: 'sunset.png',
 *          },
 *          {
 *             name: 'bar',
 *             srcs: 'load-bar.{png,webp}',
 *          }
 *      ]
 *   },
 *   {
 *      name:'game-screen',
 *      assets:[
 *          {
 *             name: 'character',
 *             srcs: 'robot.png',
 *          },
 *          {
 *             name: 'enemy',
 *             srcs: 'bad-guy.png',
 *          }
 *      ]
 *   }]
 * }}
 *
 * await PIXI.Asset.init({
 *  manifest
 * });
 *
 * // load a bundle..
 * loadScreenAssets = await PIXI.Assets.loadBundle('load-screen');
 * // load another..
 * gameScreenAssets = await PIXI.Assets.loadBundle('game-screen');
 * ```
 * @example
 * const bunny = await PIXI.Assets.load('bunny.png');
