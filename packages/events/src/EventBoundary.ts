 * Event boundaries are "barriers" where events coming from an upstream scene are modified before downstream propagation.
 *
 * ## Root event boundary
 *
 * The {@link PIXI.EventSystem#rootBoundary rootBoundary} handles events coming from the &lt;canvas /&gt;.
 * {@link PIXI.EventSystem} handles the normalization from native {@link https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#event Events}
 * into {@link PIXI.FederatedEvent FederatedEvents}. The rootBoundary then does the hit-testing and event dispatch
 * for the upstream normalized event.
 *
 * ## Additional event boundaries
 *
 * An additional event boundary may be desired within an application's scene graph. For example, if a portion of the scene is
 * is flat with many children at one level - a spatial hash maybe needed to accelerate hit testing. In this scenario, the
 * container can be detached from the scene and glued using a custom event boundary.
